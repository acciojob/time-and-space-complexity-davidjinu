	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a programming term that quantifies the amount of time it takes a sequence of code or an algorithm to process or execute in proportion to the size and cost of input.The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program. O(n) – constant complexity – takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size</p>
